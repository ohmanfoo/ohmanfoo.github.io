“The best way to protect the  [[child]] ren is to bring the level of  [[virus]]  circulation in the community down.”
Dr. Anthony  [[Fauci]]  is warning that unvaccinated  [[kids]]  are more likely to contract the  COVID -19 Delta variant because it is so highly transmissible.
The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious  [[Disease]] s at the  [[NIH]]  and [[top]] adviser to President Joe Biden told “ [[CBS]]  This Morning” on Wednesday that  [[kids]]  are not necessarily more susceptible to the contagious strain. But the concern is anyone who is unvaccinated, including  [[kids]] , is more likely to be infected by the new strain since it is so much more contagious.
Health officials in the  [[United States]]  announced Tuesday that the Delta variant now accounts for about one in every five  COVID -19 cases in the country, doubling its presence in the last two weeks.
“This  [[virus]]  is more a transmissible  [[virus]] , therefore,  [[child]] ren will more likely get infected with this than they would with the Alpha variant,”  [[Fauci]]  said.

The nation’s [[top]] infectious disease expert told “Today” on Wednesday that in the next several weeks, he expects the Delta variant to be dominant.
“That’s the sobering news,” he said. 
 [[Fauci]]  said the U.S. is doing well with  [[vaccine]] s, even though the nation is falling short of its goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the  [[American]]  population by  [[July]]  4th. But he said he is concerned for those who remain unvaccinated, since the  [[vaccine]] s do “quite well” against the contagious variant.
“If they are unvaccinated, they are at risk,” the scientist said. “Whereas those who are vaccinated can have a great Fourth of  [[July]] . You can just do all the things you want to do on the Fourth of  [[July]]  if, in fact, you’re vaccinated.”
According to the Centers for  [[Disease]]  Control and Prevention, a large proportion of  [[adults]]  aged 18 to 39 years old are expressing hesitancy about getting vaccinated. 
The solution to addressing lingering hesitancy,  [[Fauci]]  said, is to have people “in the trenches getting to people,” continuing to have conversations with people who are hesitant and bringing trusted community members in to help. 
Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency room physician and director of the Brown Lifespan Center for Digital Health, agreed, urging on Twitter that “person-to-person conversations” will help drive a change in the vaccination rates for the population.
For  [[kids]]  under the age of 12 who remain ineligible for the  [[vaccine]] s,  [[Fauci]]  advised continuing to be careful and abiding by public health recommendations to prevent the spread of  COVID -19, such as wearing a mask outside the household.
“The best way to protect the  [[child]] ren is to bring the level of  [[virus]]  circulation in the community down,”  [[Fauci]]  said. “The best way to do that is that those — i.e.  [[adults]]  — who are eligible for vaccination to get vaccinated so you’re not only protecting yourself, but by bringing the level of  [[virus]]  down in the community, you’re indirectly protecting the  [[child]] ren who can’t yet get vaccinated. That’s one of the most important ways to do that.”
“In several weeks to a month or so, it’s going to be quite dominant.”
