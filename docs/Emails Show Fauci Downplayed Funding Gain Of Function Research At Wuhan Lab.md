Emails Show   [[Fauci]]   Downplayed Funding Gain Of Function   [[Research]]  At   [[Wuhan]]   Lab
Excerpt
Dr. Anthony   [[Fauci]]   knew about U.S. funding for the gain of function   [[research]]  occurring at the   [[Wuhan]]   lab in   [[China]]   but downplayed its role in the   COVID -19   [[pandemic]]  , new emails show.
Dr. Anthony   [[Fauci]]   knew about U.S. funding for the gain of function   [[research]]  occurring at the   [[Wuhan]]   lab in   [[China]]   but downplayed its role in the   COVID -19   [[pandemic]]  , new emails show.   [[Fauci]]   recently denied that specific   [[research]]  was used by the overseas Virology Institute or funded by him.
In emails acquired by Buzzfeed   [[News]] ,   [[Fauci]]   conversed with NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss in a conversation labeled “IMPORTANT” about an   artic le detailing the gain of function   [[research]]  occurring in   [[Wuhan]]   through the   [[Wuhan]]   Virology Institute.
“Hugh, it is essential that we speak this AM,” he wrote. “Read this paper… You will have tasks today that must be done.”
“The paper you sent me says the   [[experiment]] s  were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by   [[NIH]]  ,” Auchincloss said in a Feb. 1,   [[2020]]   email thread with   [[Fauci]]  . “Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Corona  [[virus]]  work has gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.”
In his reply,   [[Fauci]]   said “OK. Stay tuned.”
Annnnd here come the smoking guns.
