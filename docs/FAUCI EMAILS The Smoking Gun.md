I have been following, [[research]]ing and writing about Anthony [[Fauci]] and the part he played in the [[Covid-19]] saga since early [[2020]].
Here are a few of my articles:
Anthony [[Fauci]] LIES to [[Congress]] About Funding ‘Gain of Function [[Research]]’ at the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology as he is Grilled by Rand Paul
Former [[NY Times]] [[Science]] Editor Say [[Fauci]] Did Approve “Gain of Function” [[Research]]
L[[ETH]]AL INJECTION -[[Wuhan]] Connection: [[Washington]] Post Columnist Describes Dr. [[Fauci]] as “Godfather of ‘Gain of Function [[Research]]’

Emails Show [[Fauci]] Downplayed [[NIH]] Funding Of Gain Of Function [[Research]] At [[Wuhan]] Lab
JUNE 2, 2021 By Jordan Davidson
Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]] knew about U.S. funding for the gain of function [[research]] occurring at the [[Wuhan]] lab in [[China]] but downplayed its role in the [[COVID-19]] [[pandemic]], new emails show. [[Fauci]] recently denied that specific [[research]] was used by the overseas Virology Institute or fundedby him.
In emails acquired by Buzzfeed [[News]], [[Fauci]] conversed with NIAID Principal Deputy Director Hugh Auchincloss in a conversation labeled “IMPORTANT” about an article detailing the gain of function [[research]] occurring in [[Wuhan]] through the [[Wuhan]] Virology Institute.
“Hugh, it is essential that we speak this AM,” he wrote. “Read this paper… You will have tasks today that must be done.”
“The paper you sent me says the [[experiment]]s were performed before the gain of function pause but have since been reviewed and approved by [[NIH]],” Auchincloss said in a Feb. 1, [[2020]] email thread with [[Fauci]]. “Not sure what that means since Emily is sure that no Corona[[virus]] work has gone through the P3 framework. She will try to determine if we have any distant ties to this work abroad.”

Annnnd here come the smoking guns.
Feb 1, [[2020]] [[Fauci]] exchanged emails with Hugh Auchincloss – a big cheese at the NIAID
I'm still trying to thread through these but here are a series of emails with email subject line: "IMPORTANT"
The real subject: gain of function [[research]]. pic.twitter.com/5TIfrp9sSZ

The U.S. [[government]] banned funding for the gain of function [[research]] in [[2014]] but the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology was still operating and conducting the controversial [[research]] using U.S. taxpayer dollars. This funding was funneled unscrutinized to the EcoHealth Alliance by the NIAID led by [[Fauci]] to propel [[Wuhan]] studies on bat corona[[virus]]es and allowed NIAID to hide [[research]] that they said didn’t meet the standard for “gain of function” from the Potential Pandemic Pathogens Control and Oversight Framework review board.
[[Fauci]] previously defended gain of function [[research]] in [[2012]] and said it might be worth it even if it caused a [[pandemic]].
“In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the [[virus]], which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a [[pandemic]]?” [[Fauci]] wrote. “Scientists working in this field might say — as indeed I have said — that the benefits of such [[experiment]]s and the resulting knowledge outweigh the risks.”
Just last month, Sen. Rand Paul blasted [[Fauci]] for denying that funding for the [[Wuhan]] lab that [[experiment]]ed with bat-based corona[[virus]]es came from his department at the National Institutes of Health.
“Gain of function [[research]], as you know, is juicing up naturally occurring animal [[virus]]es to infect humans. To arrive at the truth, the U.S. [[government]] should admit that the [[Wuhan]] Virology Institute was [[experiment]]ing to enhance the corona[[virus]]’s ability to infect humans,” Paul said during the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing.
[[Fauci]], however, denied that the super [[virus]] creation [[research]] by Ralph Baric, a U.S. virologist, and Shi Zhengli at the [[Wuhan]] Virology Institute was funded by the National Institutes of Health.
“Senator Paul, with all due respect, you are entirely, entirely, and completely incorrect,” [[Fauci]] said. “The [[NIH]] has not ever and does not now fund gain of function [[research]] in the [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology. Dr. Baric does not do gain of function [[research]] and if it is, it is according to the guidelines and is being conducted in [[North]] Carolina, not in [[China]].”
[[Fauci]] also denied that the money that was funneled by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious [[Disease]]s to nonprofit EcoHealth Alliance “to study bat-based corona[[virus]]es in [[China]]” including at the [[Wuhan]] lab was “gain-of-function.” Source
Brethren, I am praying for the truth to finally come out so that the people of this world will see clearly the part that Anthony [[Fauci]] played in the Covid debacle.
