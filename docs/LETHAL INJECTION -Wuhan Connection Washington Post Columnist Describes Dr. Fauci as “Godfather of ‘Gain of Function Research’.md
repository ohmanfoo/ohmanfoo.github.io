L[[ETH]]AL INJECTION -[[Wuhan]] Connection: [[Washington]] Post Columnist Describes Dr. [[Fauci]] as “Godfather of ‘Gain of Function [[Research]]’ – Absolute Truth from the Word of God

Brethren, I know how frustrating it is to try to explain to most people how dangerous the [[m[[RNA]]]] jabs are, and also the other jabs which are causing blood clots. These people are duped by the Leftist media, and no matter what “Facts” you present to them, if it does not match the narrative – they reject it.
The reader may remember that I wrote several articles on the dangerous GOFR (Gain of Function [[Research]]). This is still going on in the [[Wuhan]] Lab! Taxpayer money is being sent to the Lab until [[2024]]. Here are two of the articles I wrote about GOFR:
THE PLOT THICKENS: [[China]]’s Massive Infiltration of U.S. Virus [[Research]] Laboratories Since [[1990]]’s With the Help of ANTHONY FAUCI
From  [[liberty]]unyielding.com

Scientists fear criticizing “gain-of-function” [[research]] or saying [[COVID-19]] may have [[leaked]] from a lab because it would risk their careers and [[government]] funding, according to [[Washington]] Post columnist Josh Rogin.
“People don’t want to think about the fact that our hero of the [[pandemic]] Dr. [Anthony] [[Fauci]] might also have been connected to this [[research]] which might also have been connected to the outbreak” of [[COVID-19]], Rogin said.
U.S. dependence on [[China]]’s supply chain has allowed [[China]] to threaten retaliation if the U.S. is critical of [[China]]’s role in [[COVID-19]]’s outbreak, Rogin writes in his book.
The simplest explanation for the [[pandemic]]’s origin is a leak from a [[Wuhan]] lab, according to Rogin.

People do not want to acknowledge Dr. Anthony [[Fauci]]’s possible role in contributing to the outbreak of [[COVID-19]], according to a [[Washington]] Post columnist.
“People don’t want to think about the fact that our hero of the [[pandemic]] Dr. [[Fauci]] might also have been connected to this [[research]] which might also have been connected to the outbreak” of [[COVID-19]], [[Washington]] Post columnist Josh Rogin told The Megyn Kelly Show on Wednesday.
[[Fauci]] is director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious [[Disease]]s. The [[NIH]] has funded “gain of function” [[research]], which aims to predict future [[pandemic]]s and create [[vaccine]]s by creating novel strains of [[virus]]es. But those strains can be highly transmissible and deadly.
“The head of the entire field really is Anthony [[Fauci]] — he’s the godfather of gain-of-function [[research]] as we know it” said Rogin, adding that what he said was “too hot for TV.”
Rogin cautioned that he was not saying [[Fauci]] did anything illegal, but that the public should be more aware of this type of [[research]]. (RELATED: Are The Benefits Of Dangerous Gain-Of-Function [[Research]] Really Worth The Risks?)
“There’s plenty of evidence to support the still unproven theory that [[COVID-19]] originated from an accidental leak from one of the labs in [[Wuhan]] that was doing gain of function [[research]],” Rogin told Kelly. (RELATED: Here’s Why To Not Dismiss the Lab Leak Theory)
The [[Wuhan]] Institute of Virology lab gathers bats for gain-of-function [[research]] on corona[[virus]]es, supported with millions of dollars in U.S. taxpayer funds, Rogin said. The lab is 10 miles from where [[COVID-19]] is thought to have broken out and the lab had “very little to no oversight,” according to Rogin.
“If you were an alien and dropped down on earth” and looked at the evidence, the simplest explanation for the [[virus]]’s origin is a lab leak, he said.
Scientists fear to speak out against gain-of-function [[research]] because they receive funding from the [[NIH]], according to Rogin. “So we can’t say anything like ‘gain of function might be dangerous or [[[COVID-19]]] may have come from a lab’ because we are going to loose our careers, we are going to lose our funding,” Rogin said many scientists have told him. Scientists whose whole life work was invested in gain-of-function [[research]] would have their careers and legacies “ruined forever.”
“More and more” scientists are feeling free to say it is worth considering if [[COVID-19]] [[leaked]] from a lab after the former director of the Centers for [[Disease]] Control said he considers a lab leak the most likely source of [[COVID-19]], Rogin said. (RELATED: Former Director Of [[CDC]] Is Just The Latest Of Several Top Officials Supporting Lab Leak Theory)
U.S. dependence on [[China]]’s supply chain has allowed [[China]] to threaten retaliation if the U.S. is critical of [[China]]’s role in [[COVID-19]]’s outbreak, Rogin wrote in his book, “Chaos Under Heaven: Trump, Xi, and the Battle for the Twenty-First Century.”

The media coverage of the lab leak theory has been dismissive and biased because the press believed scientists more than the Trump administration, Rogin said. But Donald Trump is no longer president and “a lot more evidence is now pointing to the lab” a year since the [[pandemic]] started, so journalists who said a lab leak was a conspiracy theory should consider if they were mistaken, Rogin said.

Brethren, the truth about [[Fauci]] is finally coming out and that is good. But do not think for one second that Satan will not rage against this. Many people (including myself) will be in danger. The globalists do NOT want this scheme by [[Fauci]] and Gates to be laid bare for all the world to see!
Pray brethren – pray like you have never prayed before!
